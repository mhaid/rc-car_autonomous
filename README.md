# RC-Car Autonomous

In this README you will find a complete installation-guide on how to use (and train your own) object classifier.
As this tutorial is primary for Windows, most commands have to be slightly edited to run under Linux.
But most parts, except CUDA will also exceute well un MacOS by changing the commands slightly as well.
If you want to use my pretrained object detector, follow this [part] of the how-to.
Otherwise to train your own detector, start [here.]

## Use pretrained model

Follow this guide, to detect signs with your rc-car and the pretrained model.

### 1. Download files

First of all, you have to download the following files:

#### 1a. Clone 'mhaid/rc-car_autonomous'-repository

To download this repository as a zip-file click [here](https://github.com/mhaid/rc-car_autonomous/archive/master.zip).
Unpack the file, move it in your 'C:\'-directory and rename the folder from 'rc-car_autonomous-master' to 'rc-car' to shorten commands and make the following process easier.
If you rather like to clone, clone the repository into your 'C:\'-drive and check if it's named the same way as stated above.
```
C:\> git clone https://github.com/mhaid/rc-car_autonomous.git
```

### 2. Move files to raspberry pi

.


### 3. Upload Arduin script

.

### 4. Test your creation

Now comes the fun part: Finally test out your autonomous rc-car.

Before you start your scripts I will have to provide a short disclaimer: I am not responsible for any damage or injuries caused by using the scripts and tools provided in this project. This is just a guidline on how you could setup your autonomous rc-car and therefore I do not guarantee that this project will work or will show the expected results. The use of the provided scripts and tools is at your own risk!


## Train your own model

Please follow this [guid](https://github.com/mhaid/rc-car_autonomous/blob/master/computer/README.md).
